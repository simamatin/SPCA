# Kindred Kin (SPCA) Website (Landing Page)

This is the repository for the Kindred Kin (SPCA) website project. The project utilizes the following JavaScript libraries for enhanced visual effects:

## Rellax.js (Parallax)
Rellax.js is used to create parallax scrolling effects on the website. Parallax scrolling adds depth and dimension to the website by moving background elements at a different speed than foreground elements, creating a visually appealing experience for users.

## Particle.js
Particle.js is employed to generate particle effects in the background of the website. These dynamic particles add interactivity and visual interest to the website, enhancing its overall aesthetic appeal and creating a captivating user experience.

### Usage
To incorporate Rellax.js and Particle.js into your project, follow these steps:
1. Include the respective JavaScript files (`rellax.min.js` for Rellax.js and `particles.js` for Particle.js) in your project directory.
2. Link these JavaScript files in your HTML file using `<script>` tags.
3. Configure the desired settings for each library according to your project requirements.
